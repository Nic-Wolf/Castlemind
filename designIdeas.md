Overall Layout Design Ideas: 

-Hints can be displayed above board, previous moves below.
-Hints could have animations(buzz), number of hints being displayed decreases as each move is made.


When user launches app:

-Could first display castle mind title page, then slide away to reveal generated game- board. Once you create new game, hints and movement bars will load/fade-in.
